# Monitoring Stack

This repo contains a lightweight monitoring and logging stack using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Loki**, and **Alloy**, plus a script for installing **Node Exporter** on remote servers.

---
## Recommended Minimum Server Requirements
CPU cores | 4 to 8+

RAM | 16 GB to 32 GB+

Storage | 200 GB SSD to 500 GB SSD

## Port Requirements
### Minimum Ports To Expose

  - Grafana:    3000:3000
  - Loki:       3100:3100
  - Prometheus  9100:9100

### If using ufw: 
```
sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp
sudo ufw allow 3100/tcp
sudo ufw allow 9100/tcp
```

### Optional Ports (only if you want external access)
If you want to also access the interfaces for debugging or manually checking them:

  - Prometheus UI: 9090

  - Alloy internal server: 12345 (mostly for internal Alloy diagnostics â€” not needed for normal operation)

  But for basic functionality with Grafana only, you can ignore exposing these.

## Clone and enter the directory:

**Important:** Ensure you are inside the root directory --> /root
``cd root``

```
git clone https://github.com/jessmott18/monitoring.git 
```

```
cd monitoring
```

## What's Included

- `docker-compose.yml` â€“ Runs the core stack

  Within Docker Compose, services can communicate with each other over the internal Docker network by container names (e.g., http://loki:3100).
- `prometheus.yml` â€“ Prometheus config with custom scrape targets
- `loki-config.yaml` â€“ Loki log storage configuration
- `config.alloy` â€“ Alloy log forwarding setup (collection by docker container and directory)
- `install-node-exporter.sh` â€“ Shell script to install Node Exporter on any Linux server

## Recommended File Updates:
Inside `config.alloy`:
```
local.file_match "debug_log" {
  path_targets = [
    --> {__path__ = "/tmp/*.log" },
        {__path__ = "..."},
  ]
}
```
To collect logs by directory/file: **Update** `__path__ = "..."`  line with desired path to directory/files


Inside `prometheus.yml`:
Add a new server to collect metrics from. Edit and add this to the end of your file.


Any server you want to collect metrics from needs to be listed as a job with its IP address in this file.
All these servers also need to be running NodeExporter(install at bottom of README)

```yaml
  - job_name: "server"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['serverIP:9100']
```

## PostgreSQL
Grafana uses a PostgreSQL database (postgres container) for persistent storage of dashboards, users, and settings. PostgreSQL will automatically be initialized with the credentials provided in docker-compose.yml.

##  Getting Started (Main Server)

### StartÂ Everything

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Important:** There should be five containers running -- check with ```docker ps```

If there is not five, ```docker compose down``` & ```docker compose up -d```


Access your tools:

- Grafana: http://\<ServerIP>:3000 (user: `admin`, pass: `admin`)
- Prometheus: http\://\<ServerIP>:9090 (optional)
- Loki API: http://\<ServerIP>:3100    (optional)

---

## Access Grafana Dashboard

**Important:** After first login (admin/admin), Grafana will require you to set a new password. Use a strong password immediately to secure the environment.

### Add Prometheus and Loki as Data Sources

Navigate to: **Connections â†’ Data Sources â†’ Add data source**

1. **Prometheus**
    
    - Prometheus Server URL: `http://prometheus:9090`
        
2. **Loki**
    
    - Connection URL: `http://loki:3100`
        

### Display Metrics

1. Go to **Dashboards** â†’ click **New** â†’ **Import**
    
2. Paste this ID: `1860` and click Load
    
3. Load "Node Exporter" dashboard with datasource prometheus
    
4. Set datasource to **prometheus**
    
5. Switch between jobs in the job dropdown to view metrics from different servers
    

Explore more dashboards here: [Grafana Dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/)

There will be no metrics shown until a server listed in `prometheus.yml` is running NodeExporter: 

To collect metrics from this Monitoring server run the script: (Change time in top right to last 10 minutes. It will take a minute to properly view the metrics in the dashboard)
```
chmod +x install-node-exporter.sh
./install-node-exporter.sh
```

---

## View Loki Logs

1. Navigate to **Drilldown â†’ Logs**
    
2. All incoming docker container logs and files (specified in config.alloy for each server) will show
    
3. Use filter to browse logs by container and filename name from incoming servers


Note: The newest version of Loki generates many errors due to an error on their end. You can ignore these for now. I will keep my eye on updates to Loki. 
---


##  Install Node Exporter on Target Servers

Run this script on each server you want to monitor:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessmott18/monitoring/main/install-node-exporter.sh
chmod +x install-node-exporter.sh
./install-node-exporter.sh
```
You can disable Node Exporter anytime:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable node_exporter
```
